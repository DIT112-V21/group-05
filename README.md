## Description

### What you are going to make?
We are going to create a platform which is mainly aimed towards usage inside closed enviroments such as hospitals. The platform will include features that will let users control a delivery car remotely by relying on an interface that implements car controls as well as a camera. The camera will be used to navigate the car during the delivery while not having to rely on direct vision over the car to control it.

### Why will you make it?
We will make this platform to promote social distancing which is to prevent contact between people to minimize the spreading of the on going pandemic. Hospitals are the biggest is zones to contract the virus. Thus we wish to develop a platform that will help in minimizing the spread. 

### What problem does it solve?
Through lessening the contact staff members and patients have in hospitals, it will help further minimizing the spread of the virus. As patients need deliveries such as medicine, prescriptions, and food, the platform we are working on will prove to be a great aid to keep patients and staff members safe from virus spreading.

### How you are going to make it?
We are going to be using two emulators that will emulate both the wireless car as well as the software that is used to control the car. We can then use the code and software to implement it into real hardware for practical usage.

### The Car
The car uses the [SMCE](https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/smce-gd/releases) emulator to compile and emulate the sketches

### The App
The app uses [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0eewkYHs8AIVgd-yCh2wugJREAAYASAAEgKKkvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) to run the app inside the built-in emulator of the software.

## Demo Video
The demo video is uploaded to youtube and it's streamed on that platform as well. By clicking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtVZ1C6n5tk) you will be redircted to the demo video for our project.

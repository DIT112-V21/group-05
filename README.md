[ To promote social distancing and to reduce the spread of the on going pandemic. As hospitals is among the highest risk zones to contract the virus we wish to develop a prototype used to lessen the amount of contact staff and patients have with each others by introducing this remote driven service vehicle. ]
What problem does it solve?
[ By lessening the amount of contact staff and patients need to have in hospitals, it will help further lessen the spread of the virus that is very active today. ]
